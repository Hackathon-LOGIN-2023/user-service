# Aircraft Models API Project

Simple API Rest created in Express & NodeJS that lists (and adds) the different aircraft models along with their IATA code.

## How to get it and run it?
1. Create the repository and perform the respective `git clone` according to the instructions given by the site
2. Execute the command `npm install` to download the necessary packages to your local repository
3. To run it in development environment, run the command `node src/index.js` (soon I will create custom NPM scripts to run it)
4. Browse to `http://localhost:3000/`
